This project is an interactive remix of a comparative literary analysis of Kate Chopin's "The Story of an Hour" and Richard Wright's "The Man Who Was Almost a Man."



How to Run

This project is a single, self-contained index.html file.

Save the code as a file named index.html.

Open the file in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).

An internet connection is required to load the p5.js library.



Interactivity
The screen is a visual diptych, split into two halves, each representing a character's story.

Left Side (Louise Mallard): This panel represents Louise's internal, domestic world.

Action: Move your mouse over the left panel.

Effect: The grey, slow-moving particles will burst into vibrant color and energetic motion, symbolizing her brief, internal vision of freedom. When the mouse leaves, her world returns to grey, showing the fragility of her hope.

Right Side (Dave Saunders): This panel represents Dave's external, oppressive environment.

Action: Click anywhere on the right panel.

Effect: A fiery gunshot will erupt from Dave's character (the red circle). This is immediately followed by an explosion of laughing and pointing emojis, symbolizing the public humiliation that crushes his bid for manhood. The animation is replayable.



Technologies Used
HTML: For the basic page structure.

CSS: For simple styling of the title.
